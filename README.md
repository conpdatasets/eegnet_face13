## Task Description

This task involved two trial types focused on visual response times to varied stimuli. In the first, static images were displayed briefly (250 ms) with a randomized interstimulus interval (ISI) between 500 and 750 ms. Participants responded by pressing left or right buttons in reaction to infrequent half-circle checkerboards on either side of the display. The second trial type employed a sequence of images filtered for spatial frequency, resembling a dynamic animation in rapid succession. This method assessed responses to visual motion and image transitions in human perception.

## Participant Demographics Disclaimer

In accordance with Brock University guidelines, age-related variables have been artificially created and are therefore "coded".
